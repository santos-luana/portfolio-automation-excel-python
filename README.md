# 📊 Report Automation with Python and Excel

## Context
Operational and industrial environments often rely on repetitive Excel reports built manually from multiple data sources. This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and limits the analyst’s ability to focus on insights rather than execution.

This project demonstrates how Python can be used to automate the generation and cleaning of Excel-based reports, improving efficiency, consistency, and decision support.

---

## Problem
Manual report generation usually involves:
- Cleaning raw data exported from systems
- Standardizing column names and formats
- Aggregating indicators
- Rebuilding the same Excel report periodically

This workflow increases operational risk and consumes valuable analyst time.

---

## Solution
A Python-based automation pipeline that:
- Reads raw Excel data
- Cleans and standardizes the dataset
- Generates a structured report automatically
- Exports the final result to Excel, ready for analysis or dashboards

The solution was designed with operational KPIs in mind, commonly used in industrial and logistics contexts.
